# Healthcare Management System (SQL Project)

## Overview
Designed a healthcare-focused relational database system using SQL to efficiently manage patient, provider, and administrative workflows. The system supports clinical documentation, billing, and appointment scheduling in a simulated hospital setting.

## Tools Used
- MySQL
- SQL (DDL, DML, Joins, Aggregations)

## Skills Demonstrated
- Database Design
- Data Modeling & Normalization
- Query Optimization
- Clinical Workflow Integration

## Project Steps
1. Identified hospital operational needs and converted them into ER diagrams.
2. Created and normalized tables for patients, doctors, billing, visits, departments, etc.
3. Wrote queries to:
   - Retrieve appointments by doctor/department
   - Generate billing reports
   - Check patient medical records
4. Applied constraints and indexing for data integrity and performance.

## Outcome
Improved efficiency in hospital operations and reduced data redundancy while enabling reliable health record retrieval and billing processes.
